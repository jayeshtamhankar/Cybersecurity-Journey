## Cybersecurity-Journey

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Journey! This repository is dedicated to documenting my cybersecurity journey. During this Cybersecurity Journey, I will upload everything I learn.

## About Me

I'm **Jayesh Tamhankar**, a passionate front-end web developer with a keen interest in crafting beautiful and user-friendly web experiences.

I encountered a significant setback when one of my websites fell victim to a cyber attack. The experience was eye-opening and made me realize the critical importance of cybersecurity in today's digital landscape. Determined to prevent such incidents in the future and safeguard not only my own projects but also those of others, I've embarked on a journey to learn cybersecurity from the ground up.

This repository serves as a documentation of my cybersecurity learning journey. Here, I'll be sharing my progress, insights, resources, and any projects I undertake as I delve deeper into the realm of cybersecurity. My goal is not only to enhance my own understanding but also to contribute to a safer and more secure online environment for everyone.
